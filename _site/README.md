# Game List
Besides a project in dire need of a better name, this is the sandbox where I keep working on an idea to manage games that I'm currently playing, have played, or intend to play at some point.

So far the project works solely on Jekyll collections. Originally was using SiteLeaf as an admin panel to add and edit games, but wish to eventually create my own.
